Changing Directories
cd - change directory
cd [path]
Absolute Path - Path that starts from main directory
Relative Path - Path from current directory

pwd

If pwd gives C:\Users

To move to Abc folder in C:\Users
Absolute path -> cd C:\Users\Abc
Relative path -> cd Abc

cd ..
	It takes to the directory containing the present directory

cd ~ 
	Shortcut / path to home directory

Note: Tab Completion - rotates the options, . means present directory


Adding Directories
mkdir [name]- make directory
Ex: mkdir MyDirectory

Note: In CLI the Directory name cannot be given with spaces as below
>mkdir My Directory
It considers Directory as an argument of mkdir command, So to include space we can use backquote(`) 
i.e., escape character in powershell or write name in single quotes
>mkdir My` Directory   (or) >mkdir 'MyDirectory'

Note : PowerShell feature called history. Each and every time you enter in a command,
it gets saved into memory and added to a special file. 
You can go through the previous commands you used with the history command using the top and down arrows. 

>history 
Ctrl-R => shortcut for back search or in the history
Ex: Ctrl-R My =>outputs mkdir MyDirectory

clear 
It does not wipe history, it just clears output on the screen
