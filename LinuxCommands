Linux Commands


Listing the directory content
ls 
	It lists all the directories in the current working directory
	
ls /
	It lists all the directories in root folder

ls -l 
	Long listing(detailed info)
	
[cmd] --help
	It shows the list of flags that can be used with the command
	
man [cmd]
	Same as above with more details(manual/man pages)
	
ls -l -a   (or) ls -la
	Shows the hidden files too(l - long listing, a - all)
	
Note : You can hide a file in Linux by prepending . to the file name
Ex: .info - is a hidden file


cd - change directory
cd [path]
Absolute Path - Path that starts from main directory
Relative Path - Path from current directory

pwd
	Present Working Directory
If pwd gives /Home/Users

To move to Abc folder in /Home/Users
Absolute path -> cd /Home/Users/Abc
Relative path -> cd Abc

cd ..
	It takes to the directory containing the present directory
Ex: cd ../[folder]

cd ~ 
	Shortcut / path to home directory
Ex: cd ~/Desktop

Note: Tab Completion - shows all options at once, . means present directory


Adding Directories
mkdir [name]- make directory
Ex: mkdir MyDirectory

Note: In CLI the Directory name cannot be given with spaces as below
>mkdir My Directory
It considers Directory as an argument of mkdir command, So to include space we can use backslash(\) 
i.e., escape character in bash or write name in single quotes
>mkdir My\ Directory   (or) >mkdir 'MyDirectory'

Note : Bash feature called history. Each and every time you enter in a command,
it gets saved into memory and added to a special file. 
You can go through the previous commands you used with the history command using the top and down arrows. 

>history 
Ctrl-R => shortcut for back search or in the history
Ex: Ctrl-R My =>outputs mkdir MyDirectory

clear 
It does not wipe history, it just clears output on the screen
